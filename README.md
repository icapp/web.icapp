## A web prototype for the mobile app

This repo contains the web prototype to be presented as a proposal before any line is written for the specific plataforms. You may think that an entir repository is not needed for this work; but this repo is also to be used as a playground to get used to the branching model we are using.

## Technologies
For this project we will use:

* Javascript.
* HTML5.
* CSS3.

Aditionally, we would use some other technologies that live around javascript stack, like: _Node.js, Angular.js, Yeoman_, and others.
